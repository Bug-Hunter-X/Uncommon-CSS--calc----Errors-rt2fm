The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS.  However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if the order of operations is not carefully considered. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 20);` will cause errors because the second value lacks a unit.  Another issue arises when nesting `calc()` expressions, where the browser may not evaluate them correctly in all cases.  Finally, the use of `calc()` with older browsers might require vendor prefixes.
